Critically, the overall Confluence Score is extremely low (-10/100) and Signal Strength is rated LOW. Multi-timeframe alignment is weak, with the 4-hour EMA200 ($159.82) acting as overhead resistance and the daily chart showing a bearish structure. Order flow indicates slight ask dominance (-15.06% imbalance). The primary trend is NEUTRAL and volatility is LOW, suggesting range-bound conditions are more likely than a strong directional move. Given these factors and the instruction to strive for high conviction setups, a HOLD position is the most prudent action, awaiting a clearer signal with a more favorable risk-reward profile.",

The system's Confluence Score is low at 40/100, which, according to signal quality standards, suggests high risk and consideration for passing. Most importantly, past performance feedback shows a 0% win rate on 4 previous BUY signals and explicitly recommends focusing on higher probability setups and stricter criteria. The current setup, while bullish, does not meet these stricter criteria for a new entry due to overextension. Therefore, the prudent action is to HOLD and await a pullback to a more favorable entry point, such as the EMA20 (around $107,528) or a clear consolidation pattern, to reassess for a long position with better risk management.",

The system's 'Estimated R/R Ratio: 0.00:1' at the current price level is a critical warning. Furthermore, past performance data indicates a very low win rate (20%) for 'Trend Continuation' scenarios, which would be the primary thesis for a long position. Given these conflicting signals and risk factors, a 'Hold' stance is recommended, awaiting clearer price action or a more favorable risk-reward entry point. Confidence is set at 45% in line with historical data suggesting better performance in this range and reflecting the 'few confluences, high risk, consider passing' guideline.",
