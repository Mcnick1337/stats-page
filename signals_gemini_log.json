    "Reasoning": "Primary trend is strongly bearish (ADX 43.56), with price trading below key EMAs (20, 50, 200 on main timeframe). Order flow indicates significant ask dominance (-45.69% imbalance). While MACD shows a bullish crossover, it's below the zero line within a strong downtrend, often a weak signal or prelude to further downside. Entry targets a retest near current levels/EMA20. Low overall confluence score (-10/100) and the conflicting MACD signal warrant lower confidence, aligning with a high-risk setup.",

SL is 2x ATR below entry, undercutting EMA50/200. TPs aim for 1:1 and 2:1 R/R. High risk trade, reflecting very low confluence and concerningly low reported 24h volume.",

The trade targets the lower Bollinger Band and high volume node around $2500 as TP1, with a secondary target offering improved R/R if bearish momentum continues. Low overall market confluence (-5/100) and conflicting short-term order flow (bid dominance) warrant a lower confidence level. The 'Range-Bound' scenario has shown good historical win rates.",

Bullish MACD crossover and multi-timeframe EMA alignment (Price > EMA20 > EMA50 > EMA200 on 1H, 4H, 1D) offer support. However, extremely low 24h volume (930), low ADX (19.77 indicating weak trend strength), significant ask-side order book imbalance (-98.51%), and a low system Confluence Score (40/100) indicate high risk. This warrants cautious position sizing and a strict stop loss. Bullish news sentiment is a minor positive factor. The chosen confidence level of 45% aligns with past performance data for the 40-49% confidence bracket (53.49% WR).",

The ADX (22.44) indicates a weak trend, suggesting that a rejection at this strong resistance is more probable than a sustained breakout, especially considering the very low 24h volume (1,085) which often precedes false breakouts. Bearish news sentiment and a low overall system Confluence Score (25/100) further support a cautious approach and potential reversal.

The provided low overall confluence score (10/100), low signal strength, low volatility regime, and bearish news sentiment support a range-bound expectation rather than a strong immediate bullish follow-through.
